### Code to make sweet chloropleth plots of the world!

![Chloropleth](figs/chloropleth_world_electricity)

Here I am pulling data from the IEA 2017 report, allowing me to look at different forms of energy consumption and production across the world. 

Easily extendable to other data sources (world bank looks really cool, to come soon hopefully)

Turns out surprisingly painful to sanitize the data to talk to different databases (the joys of conflicts over what countries actually exist)
