    "\n",
    "> Energy storage consists of a suite of technologies at various stages of development. The most mature energy storage technology is pumped hydropower, generally utilized for longer periods of charge and discharge (multiple hours). Pumped hydropower represents the vast majority (99%) of storage in use (IEA, 2014b). It is economically and technically proven throughout the world. By contrast, battery storage is a new market development. Examples of other emerging storage technologies are adiabatic compressed air energy storage,  flywheels, power to gas and supercapacitors (Fuchs et al., 2012; IRENA, 2012a). Electricity can also be stored in thermal form using boilers, heat pumps, ice or chilled water, for instance. Thermal storage can be integrated with combined heat and power production and utilised to maximise wind resource penetration (Sorknaes et al., 2013). Thermal energy storage options are often cheaper than other forms of storage, though it is more di cult to reverse heat storage back into electricity (IRENA, 2013b). Typically, electric energy converted to a thermal medium is used at another time as thermal energy, either for space heating, cooling or in industrial processes.\n",

    "* Advantages (when compared to Li-Ion) include simpler BMS, thermal\n",
    "management and better safety and calendar lifetime\n",
    "* Disadvantages: Significantly lower energy content and cyclic lifetime\n",
    "* Nickel as a material is expensive, large NiMH battery systems are expensive and will probably remain so\n",
    "\n",
    "### Li-Ion\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a basic Li-ion cell consists of a cathode (positive electrode) and an anode (negative electrode) which are contacted by an electrolyte containing lithium ions. The electrodes are isolated from each other by a separator, typically microporous polymer membrane, which allows the exchange of lithium ions between the two electrodes but not electrons. In addition to liquid electrolyte, polymer, gel, and ceramic electrolyte have also been explored for applications in Li-ion batteries.\n",
    "\n",
    "> BNEF estimates that 33 GWh of manufacturing capacity was available for lithium-ion cells in 2013. This compares with a demand closer to 5 GWh (Sun, 2014) from EVs. This has reduced prices for lithium-ion chemistries as companies decrease margins to increase sales volumes. [..] However, growth in EV deployment means battery cell price decreases are not a long-term trend as excess manufacturing capacity becomes utilised (Sun, 2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "> One of the greatest obstacles facing lithium-ion is safety. The energy density of the cells and combustibil- ity of lithium, as well as the presence of oxygen, mean cells can overheat and catch fire. This can lead to a situation known as thermal runaway when neighbour- ing cells also overheat. \n",

    "> Furthermore, the cost of a complete system can be [..] determined by adding all relevant initial, variable and end-of-life costs for an installation. [..] Lithium-ion batteries utilised for distributed energy storage applications of various capacities and power output ranged from about USD 0.5-2/kWh and upwards (EPRI and DOE, 2013, p.106).\n",

    "### Redox flow battery\n",
    "\n",
    "From IRENA report:\n",
    "\n",
    "> While flow batteries comprise a small portion of the market, they are a promising longer-term battery storage solution (four hours or more). This is due to the technology’s ability to handle large energy capacity. This is easily multiplied with the addition of external tanks that store the electrolyte. Flow batteries have in the past suffered from the premature degradation of membrane materials and high costs. This must be improved if they are to become more widespread. Installations are at present relatively low. Nevertheless, this is expected to change over the next decade, as the technology shows considerable promise. Navigant estimates that around 4% of installations in 2014 will be flow battery installations in terms of installed capacity (on a power (MW) basis). This share is expected to increase to 19% by 2023 for utility-scale applications (Ja e and Adamson, 2014). The most mature flow battery chemistries at the moment are vanadium redox flow and zinc bromine redox batteries. Some other chemistries are being developed, such as iron-chromium redox flow by Enervault and zinc-iron redox flow by ViZn Energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Molten salt batteries\n",
    "\n",
    "> Sodium-sulphur batteries, sodium metal halide (also known as ZEBRA24 batteries), and a number of other battery varieties use molten salt as an electrolyte, and therefore have to operate under high temperatures. Sodium-sulphur batteries are a relatively mature composition in the power market. They were demonstrated and used in Japan by utility Tokyo Electric Power Company and NGK Insulators in the late 1990s. They have been commercially available since 2002 (EPRI and DOE, 2003). The batteries operate at high temperatures – over 300°C. They are generally used for long periods of discharge lasting six hours or even longer given sufficient capacity (EPRI and DOE, 2013). Like lead-acid batteries, sodium-sulphur batteries have a limited cycle life. They are able to charge and discharge a limited number of times before substantially degrading (IEA, 2013b). Their advantage over flow batteries (see below) is that any degradation of the electrodes (ie. cracks) are automatically repaired every time the NaS electrodes are liquefied. They have an energy density of around 60 Wh per kilogramme (kg), a cycle life of 1 500-3 000 cycles and cost of around USD 600/kWh in 2014 (Ja e and Adamson, 2014). \n",

    "Note that these are costs for the cell only!\n",
    ">  Information provided by Younicos indicates that for a lead-acid installation in Alaska, the battery represented around 40% of installation costs. For a small project in Africa, battery cells provided to AllCell Technologies were about 50% of the system’s cost.\n",

    "## Electric vehicle batteries getting cheaper much faster than expected\n",

    "What they found was that the cost of battery backs for electric vehicles has decreased from about \\$1,000 (£641) per kWh in 2007 to about \\$450 (£288) per kWh in 2014. And that's taking all battery electric vehicle manufacturers into account. When you separate out the largest companies making electric vehicles, the cost reductions get even more dramatic “[T]he cost of battery packs used by market-leading BEV manufacturers are even lower, at US\\$300 (£192) per kWh,\" the researchers added.\n",
    "\n",
    " Nykvist told Ars: “It is impossible to assess when such a low level of USD 150/kWh will be reached as it is too far into the future, but we conclude in the paper that the trajectory is very positive, and if the current momentum lasts for a couple of years... a cost level somewhere around 200-250 USD/kWh before 2020 is quite likely.”\n",

    "Ok, so where does this put us? Lets say that due to increased efficiencies etc., a plausible average world energy use in the early twenthieth century is at 80 kWh/d/p (~3 kW/p), as in SEWTHA. Multiplying this by estimated world population (~8 billion at 2030 (World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision)), we arrive at 640 TWh/d. This corresponds to 27 TW. (For reference, the US has one TW of electricity generating capacity (CIA world factbook), and a population of 320 million, which quite neatly corresponds to ~25 TW by extrapolation. As explored in SEWTHA, only about a third to a half of energy consumption is from electrical power plants, which is consistent with the US current use of closer to ~270 kWh/d/p.\n",

    "\n",
    "Well, US GDP is currently $17 trillion dollars. The world total is \\$77 trillion USD (both from World Bank 2015). So yes, I guess the answer is that it is quite a lot. For comparison, the Manhattan project cost \\$30 billion USD (from est. \\$20 billion USD in 1996 dollars, Brookings institute).\n",

    "> So what about solar farming? We could imagine using 5\\% of Europe (450 m2 per person) for solar photovoltaic farms [...]. This would deliver an average power of 5 W/m2 × 450 m2 = 54 kWh/d per person. Solar PV farming would, therefore, add up to something substantial. The main problem with photovoltaic panels is their cost. Getting power during the winter is also a concern!"
