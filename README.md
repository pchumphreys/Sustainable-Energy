# Sustainable-Energy

This repository contains some exploratory code and calculations centred around sustainable energy. Check out the chloropleth plots!

Also, a little [map](Land%20area%20for%20energy%20generation) to give some perspective on how much solar and wind we would need to go fully green..

Solar irradiance calculations are a work in progress....
